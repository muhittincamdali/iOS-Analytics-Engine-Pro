class AnalyticsEngineTests: XCTestCase {
    var analytics: AnalyticsEngine!
    
    override func setUp() {
        super.setUp()
        analytics = AnalyticsEngine(configuration: .test)
    }
    
    override func tearDown() {
        analytics = nil
        super.tearDown()
    }
    
    func testEventTracking() {
        // Given
        let event = AnalyticsEvent(name: "test_event")
        
        // When
        analytics.track(event)
        
        // Then
        XCTAssertTrue(analytics.hasTrackedEvent("test_event"))
    }
}
```

### Performance Testing
```swift
class AnalyticsPerformanceTests: XCTestCase {
    func testHighVolumeTracking() {

        measure {
            for i in 0..<10000 {
                analytics.track(event: "performance_test_\(i)")
            }
        }
    }
}
```
